UNLESS BOTH YOU AND EBAY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE\nARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND\nMAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS",
    "PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND\nDECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE\nEXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S),\nEXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE\nRELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS\nPROVISION.\n2. Arbitration Procedures",
    "PROVISION.\n2. Arbitration Procedures\nArbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a\njudge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can\naward the same damages and relief that a court can award. The arbitrator will be a retired judge or an\nattorney licensed to practice law in the state in which you reside and will be selected by the parties",
    "from the appropriate list of arbitrators provided by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). If\nthe parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the AAA’s list,\nthen the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA’s rules. All issues are for the\narbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this Agreement to\nArbitrate.",
    "Arbitrate.\nThe AAA's rules will govern the arbitration, except as provided in this Agreement to Arbitrate. The\nAAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The party initiating\nan arbitration proceeding will be responsible for paying the filing fees associated with the arbitration,\nunless otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or by law.\nFor arbitration proceedings that are conducted by video conference, the parties will use good faith",
    "efforts to agree upon a video conferencing platform that is mutually acceptable. If the parties are\nunable to agree upon a video conferencing platform, then the AAA will select the video conferencing\nplatform.\nIn the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as\ncompared to the costs of litigation, eBay will pay as much of the filing, administration and arbitrator's",
    "fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. In the\nevent that the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as\nmeasured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), you agree to reimburse\neBay for all fees associated with the arbitration that eBay has paid on your behalf which you\notherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA rules.\n3. Location of Arbitration",
    "3. Location of Arbitration\nUnless you and eBay agree otherwise, any arbitration hearing will take place in the county of your\nresidence, or in a mutually agreed upon location.\n4. Arbitration Award\nThe arbitrator's award will be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any\ncourt having jurisdiction.\n5. Severability\nIf the prohibition against class and representative actions and non-individualized relief set forth above",
    "is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void.\nThe remainder of the User Agreement shall continue to apply.\n6. Future Changes to the Agreement to Arbitrate\nNotwithstanding any provision in the User Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if eBay\nmakes any change to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than a change to any notice address or",
    "website link provided herein) in the future, that change will not apply to any claim that was filed in a\nlegal proceeding against eBay prior to the effective date of the change. The change will apply to all\nother disputes or claims governed by the Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise\nbetween you and eBay.
